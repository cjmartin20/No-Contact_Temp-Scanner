You may get a warning about about Wayland/Gnome and the full screen doesn't look right-
$ sudo gedit /etc/gdm/custom.conf 
Uncomment this line:
WaylandEnable=falese
Add this line to the [daemon] section:
DefaultSession=gnome-xorg.desktop 

Serial Communicaton Notes
The port is hard coded as /dev/ttyACM0 for Federa 33. This is at the top of the temperature.cpp file.
Make sure to run program as root or give user permissions to use the serial port.
